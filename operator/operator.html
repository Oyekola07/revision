    <h2>Operator</h2>
    <p>An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example, in 1 + 2, the + sign is an operator and 1 is left side operand and 2 is right side operand. The + operator performs the addition of two numeric values and returns a result.</p>

    <p>However, there are different types of Operators. e.g. <br>
        <br>
        1. &nbsp; Arithmetic operator <br>
        2. &nbsp Comparison Operator <br>
        3. &nbsp Logical Operator <br>
        4. &nbsp Assignment Operator
